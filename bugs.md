# Bugs

To be clear - these are bugs I have found in Minecraft itself, they aren't bugs about this behaviour pack.

I should really report these but I'm too lazy to make a Jira account. I'm sure I'll get around to it eventually...

* Vines do not work in structures when you want to rotate the structure
* When you fill an area with air then waterlogged blocks get replaced with water
* When removing the mayfly ability the player can still fly until they put their feet on the ground
* An error appears in my console when I change a structure block to "load" mode without first entering a name
* When exporting from a structure block in "load" mode it exports the structure that was loaded instead of what is currently there
* When destoying a boat/armor stand/painting I get a scripting error: [minecraft:entity_attack] Failed to parse the target entity
