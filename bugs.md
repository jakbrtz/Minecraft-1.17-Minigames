# Bugs

To be clear - these are bugs I have found in Minecraft itself, they aren't bugs about this behaviour pack.

I should really report these but I'm too lazy to make a Jira account. I'm sure I'll get around to it eventually...

* Paintings do not work in structures
* Vines do not work in structures when you want to rotate the structure
* When you fill an area with air then waterlogged blocks get replaced with water
* When removing the mayfly ability the player can still fly until they put their feet on the ground
